<p>Area is the amount of space contained in a closed shape. Because of its two-dimensional nature, area is measured in square units (square inches, sq ft, \(cm^2\)). Generally, area can only be found by the use of formulas specific to the shape being studied. Below are the formulas for common shapes.</p>

<p> Surface area is the total area on the surface of a three-dimensional object. It is simply the sum of the areas of each face of the object.</p>
