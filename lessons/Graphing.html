Graphing is a method of representing and displaying coordinates(points) or functions in a graphical space.

</p><h3>Coordinate Plane</h3><p>

Graphing occurs in a coordinate plane. This means that it is a grid, and each location has a 

unique identifier. The horizontal solid line is the x-axis and the vertical one is the y-axis. 

Where they cross is called the origin. The origin's coordinates are \((0,0)\), meaning that its x 

value is 0 and its y value is 0.

</p><h3>Ordered Pair</h3><p>
An ordered pair is the name for the coordinates of a point. Each ordered pair has an x and y 

coordinate, in that order. Given the ordered pair \((x,y)\), its graph would have a point x boxes to 

the right of the origin and y boxes above the origin. Negative numbers would cause the point 

to be to  the left or below the origin, respectively.

</p><h3>Lines</h3><p>

Lines are an infinite series of points extending in two directions. Lines are usually graphed 

with a function, which is a mathematical expression which gives a y value for every x value.

</p><h3>Distance Formula</h3><p>

It is possible to find the distance between any two points in a coordinate system by using the 

distance formula - 

</p><p>\[d=\sqrt{(x_2-x_1)^2+(y_2-y_1)^2}\]</p><p>

 - where the first point is at \((x_1,y_1)\) 

and the second is at \((x_2,y_2)\).
